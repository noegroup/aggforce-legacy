r"""Routines for for featurized non-linear force map optimization.

NOTE: Maps of this type are more complex than simple configurationally-independent force
maps and have shown any benefit. For typical force mapping, stick to linear maps.

Types and routines for general feature calculation are included.

Configurationally dependent (non-linear) force maps may be made by using a featurization
function which characterizes each configuration. The force map may then be made linear
to this featurization. The linear coefficients do not change as a function of
configuration, but the output of the featurizers do.

This module provides routines for optimizing this kind of force map. Other modules
provide additional featurization functions.

    xyz (numpy.ndarray):

    config_mapping (map.LinearMap):
        LinearMap object which characterizes configurational map.
    featurizer (callable):
        A callable for featurizing the system which uses the following as input:
            copoints (numpy.ndarray):
                3-D of shape (n_frames,n_fg_sites,n_dims=3) containing the
                copoints (positions) used for featurization
            config_mapping (map.LinearMap instance)
                configurational coarse-graining map of the system
            constraints (set of frozensets)
                Characterizes molecular constraints in the system
        and return a dictionary with the following key-value pairs:
            'feats': list/generator  of feature mats (n_frames, n_fg_sites, n_feats)
                (see below for more information)
            'divs': list/generator of divergence mats (n_frames, n_feats, n_dim)
                (see below for more information)
            'names': None or list of name strings (n_feat)
        where n_feat is the dimensionality of the features. Note that this must
        perform all of the featurizations for all sites simultaneously.
    kbt (float):
        Boltzmann constant times the temperature of the system. The units must
        match the energy portion of the forces units. Needed to account for the
        divergence correction.
    n_constraint_frames (positive integer):
        Number of frames to sample when constraining featurization index to obey
        orthogonality constraints between coarse-grained sites. A larger number
        provides a more exact constraint, but increases memory usage.
    constraints (set of frozensets of integers):
        Each entry is a frozenset of indices, the group of which is constrained.
        Currently, only bond constraints (frozensets of size 2) are supported.
    sparse (boolean):
        If true, then various matrices generated in the method are sparsified
        before being passed to the solver. This does not typically reduce the
        runtime memory usage but may remove warnings given by solvers.
    solver_args (dict):
        Passed as options to qp_solve to solve quadratic program via **.
    l2_regularization (float):
        Coefficient for penalizing the l2 norm of the parameter vector during
        quadratic programming. Note that this l2 penalty is not the same as
        that present in the simple linear map optimization: here, we penalize
        the size of the coefficient vector, as where there we penalize the
        resulting mapping. Doing so here is more complex as the mapping changes
        as a function of frame.

    Notes:
    -----
    Uses a quadratic programming solver with equality constraints.

    Additionally, the featurization function output must conform to the
    following format. The entry for the 'feat' and 'div' keys is a list, and
    each element in each list corresponds to the features that are used for a
    particular coarse-grained site; e.g., the first entry in both the feat and
    div entries correspond to coarse-grained site index 0.

    Each feats list entry is of the shape (n_frames, n_fg_sites, n_feats), where
    n_frames is the number of trajectory frames, n_fg_sites is the number of
    fine-grained sites in the system, and n_feats is the number of features
    produced (each fine-grained site in each frame has multiple features).

    Each div list entry characterizes divergence and has the shape (n_frames,
    n_feats, n_dim). In this the feature for every fg_site and frame is d'd
    w.r.t each Cartesian component (this means 3 times as many values as the
    features, but is then summed over the fine-grained sites).

    See the documentation for exp2_feat for more information.

    Vector valued feature which associates a one-hotted label to each
    fine-grained site.  Labels are unique, except that they are shared between
    constraint groups.

    Arguments:
    ---------
    points (numpy.ndarray):
        Points characterizing the positions of fine-grained sites as a function
        of time; assumed to be of shape (n_frames,n_sites,n_dims=3). Note that
        this is only used to find the number of frames of the system, but is
        included for compatibility with other featurization functions.
    cmap (map.LinearMap):
        Configurational map characterizing the relationship between the
        coarse-grained and fine-grained resolutions.
    constraints (set of frozensets of integers):
        Each frozenset describes fine-grained sites participating in a
        constraint. These constraint subsets may overlap.
    return_ids (boolean):
        If return_ids is True, return a numpy.ndarray containing the constraint
        d/group of each fine-grained site. Useful for creating other features
        which respect constraints, but not a feature in itself.

    Returns:
    -------
    If return_ids is True, return a numpy.ndarray with the shape (n_fg_sites,).
    Else: A dict with the following key-value pairs:
        'feats': list of feature mats (n_frames, n_fg_sites, total_n_feats)
            The features do not changed between frames.
        'divs': list of div mats (n_frames, total_n_feats, n_dim).
            These are filled with zeros as the features do not change as a
            function of position.
        'names': None

    NOTE: While the features are not generated lazily (they are not returned via
    generators), the entries for each cg_site are views to the same numpy array,
    so the memory footprint is only that of a single cg_site.
