    Allows multiple different representations of the same map to be used.

    The primary map format is the "standard_matrix". Given that our linear map

    coarse-grained (cg) resolution, the standard matrix is a (num. of cg
    particles) x (num. of fg particles) where each element describes how a fg

        mapping (list of lists of integers or 2-d numpy.ndarray):
            If a list of lists, then we assume the outer list iterates over
            various cg indices, and the inner lists describe the indices of
            which atoms contribute to that particular cg site. As this format
            does not make it clear how many total fg sites there are, n_fg_sites
            must be specified. If instead a 2-d numpy.ndarray, then the array is
            assumed to be of shape (num of cg,num of fg), which each element
            describing the coefficient of how the fg site contributes to the cg
            site. In this case n_fg_sites should not be specified.
        n_fg_sites (integer or None):
            Certain mapping descriptions make it ambiguous how many total
            fine-grained sites there are. This variable allows this ambiguity to
            be resolved.
        tags (dictionary or None):
            Passed to Map init.

        Example:
            [[0,2,3],[4]] with n_fg_sites=6 describes a 6 particle fg system
            and 2 particle cg system (from the length of the outer list).
            cg particle 0 (equally) depends on fg particles 0,2, and 3 as where
            cg particle 1 depends only on fg particle 4.

            The same information is given by the following 2-d matrix:
                [ 1/3 0   1/3 1/3 0   0  ]
                [ 0   0   0   0   1   0  ]

    Functionality is most easily described via an example:
        Molecular positions (and forces) are often represented as arrays of

        transform these arrays to a reduced (coarse-grained) resolution where

        (When linear) the relationship between the old (n_sites) and new
        (n_cg_sites) resolution can be described as a matrix of size
        (n_sites,n_cg_sites). This relationship is between sites, and is
        broadcast across the other dimensions. Here, the sites are contained in
        points, and the mapping relationship is in factor.

        However, we cannot directly use dot products to apply such a matrix map.
        This function applies this factor matrix as expected, in spirit of
        (points * factor).
