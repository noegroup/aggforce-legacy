    """Featurizes each fine-grained site by considering the distance to the
    coarse-grained site at each frame.

    NOTE: This function uses JAX for acceleration.

    At each frame, the distances between a coarse-grained site and each
    fine-grained site are calculated. These distances are "binned" by applying a
    series of Gaussians at multiple points along each distance. These binned
    distances are then associated separately to each atom (this is done using a
    one-hot encoding in the feature matrix).

    Fine-grained sites which are constrained together are assigned the same
    position before distance calculation and use the same one-hot slot; as a
    result, they have identical features at each frame.

    Arguments
    ---------
    points (jnp.DeviceArray):
        Positions of the fine_grained trajectory. Assumed to have shape
        (n_frames,n_fg_sites,n_dims).
    cmap (map.LinearMap):
        Configurational map that links the fine-grained and coarse-grained
        resolutions.
    constraints (set of frozensets):
        Set of frozensets, each of which contains a set of fine-grained
        sites which have a molecular constraint applied. Constrained
        groups may overlap.
    outer (positive float):
        The largest distance to consider when making the grid of Gaussians.
    inner (non-negative float):
        The smallest distance to consider when making the grid of Gaussians.
    n_basis (positive integer):
        Number of Gaussian bins to use. Higher numbers are more expressive, but
        increase memory usage.
    width (positive integer):
        Controls the width of each Gaussian. Gaussians are roughly calculated as
        exp(-d**2/width), where d is the distance.
    batch_size (positive integer):
        Number of trajectory frames to feed into JAX at once. Larger values are
        faster but use more memory.
    lazy (boolean):
        If truthy, generators of features and divs are returned; else, lists are
        returned.
    div_method (string):
        Determines how the divergence will be calculated; passed to
        gb_subfeat_jac as method.

    A dictionary with two key elements pairs:
        'feats': list/generator of feature mats (n_frames, n_fg_sites, total_n_feats)
            The features do not changed between frames.
        'divs': list/generator of div mats (n_frames, total_n_feats, n_dim).
            These are filled with zeros as the features do not change as a
            function of position.
        'names': None
    Each element of these lists corresponds to features for a single CG site,
    except for 'names', which may have names which are shared for each cg site
    (or None).

    However, note that not all the arguments are the same (see, for example, the
    allowed shaped of points and where kwargs goes).

    NOTE: Be sure to pass the same arguments to this and gb_subfeat if using
    their results in tandem (even if this function;s internal call to gb_subfeat
    changes certain arguments).

    Arguments
    ---------
    points (jnp.DeviceArray):
        Positions of the fine_grained trajectory. Assumed to have shape
        (n_frames,n_fg_sites,n_dims).
    cg_points (jnp.DeviceArray):
        Positions of coarse-grained trajectory. Assumed to have shape
        (n_frames,n_cg_sites,n_dims); current usage only considers 1 cg site at a
        time.
    channels (tuple of positive integers):
        Tuple of integers with the length of the number of fine-grained sites
        in the trajectory. Each integer assigns that fine-grained site to a
        constraint group. So, if two atoms have a constrained bond connecting
        them, they should both have the same integer. The integers to not have
        to be consecutive, but max_channels must as big as the largest channel.
    max_channels (positive integer):
        Maximum value of channels. Included as argument due to JAX constraints.
        Larger values increase memory usage, so the most memory efficient
        (max_channels,channels) pair has channels starting at 0 with maximum value
        at max_channels, with no unused index in between.
    smear_mat (jnp.DeviceArray):
        Mapping matrix multiple with points via trjdot prior to calculating
        distances. Useful for accounting for molecular constraints. Should be
        shape (n_fg_sites,n_fg_sites).
    method (string):
        if method=="basic":
            A direct Jacobian is calculated using a full gb_subfeat call with
            collapse=True.
        elif method=="reorder":
            Jacobian is calculated before one-hot-like vectors are created, and
            then itself one-hotted.
    kwargs:
        Passed to gb_subfeat.

    Returns
    -------
    jnp.DeviceArray of shape (n_frames, n_features, n_dims=3) containing the per
    frame Jacobian values summed over the fine grained particles.

@jax.jit
def trjdot(points, factor):
    """Performs a specific JAX matrix product when dealing with mdtraj-style arrays
    and a matrix.

    NOTE: This function is similar to others in this package, but applies to JAX
    arrays

    Functionality is most easily described via an example:
        Molecular positions (and forces) are often represented as arrays of
        shape (n_steps,n_sites,n_dims). Other places in the code we often
        transform these arrays to a reduced (coarse-grained) resolution where
        the output is (n_steps,n_cg_sites,n_dims).

        (When linear) the relationship between the old (n_sites) and new
        (n_cg_sites) resolution can be described as a matrix of size
        (n_sites,n_cg_sites). This relationship is between sites, and is
        broadcast across the other dimensions. Here, the sites are contained in
        points, and the mapping relationship is in factor.

        However, we cannot directly use dot products to apply such a matrix map.
        This function applies this factor matrix as expected, in spirit of
        (points * factor).

        Additionally, if instead the matrix mapping changes at each frame of the
        trajectory, this can be specified by providing a factor of shape
        (n_steps,n_cg_sites,n_sites). This situation is determined by
        considering the dimension of factor.

    Arguments
    ---------
    points (jnp.DeviceArray):
        3-dim array of shape (n_steps,n_sites,n_dims). To be mapped using
        factor.
    factor (jnp.DeviceArray):
        2-dim array of shape (n_cg_sites,n_sites) or 3-dim array of shape
        (n_steps,n_cg_sites,n_sites). Used to map points.

    Returns
    -------
    jnp.DeviceArray of shape (n_steps,n_cg_sites,n_dims) contained points mapped
    with factor.
