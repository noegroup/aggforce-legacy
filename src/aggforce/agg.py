r"""Provides interface for optimally aggregating forces.

Methods are described in the following problem setting:

We have a fine grained system (with n_fg particles) which we map to
coarse-grained system (with n_cg particles) using a linear mapping function. The
configurational portion of this map is already set; methods here provide ways to
calculate the force map.

project_forces creates a suitable force map using a variety of methods (linear and
nonlinear). project_forces_grid_cv performs cross validation.

    NOTE: Performs convenience operations (e.g., making sure the mapping matrix
    is in the correct form) so that internal methods can have strong assumptions
    about arguments.

    Arguments:
    ---------
    xyz (np.ndarray):
        Three dimensional array of shape (n_steps,n_sites,n_dims). Contains the
        positions of the fg sites as a function of time.  Note that in the case
        of linear force maps, the content of this argument is ignored for
        finding forces. However, if constrained_inds is set to 'auto', it may
        still be used to find possible constraints.
    forces (np.ndarray):
        Three dimensional array of shape (n_steps,n_sites,n_dims). Contains the
        forces on the fg sites as a function of time.
    config_mapping (map.LinearMap):
        LinearMap characterizing the fg -> cg configurational map.
    constrained_inds (set of frozensets or 'auto'):
        If a set of frozensets, then each entry is a frozenset of indices, the
        group of which is constrained.  Currently, only bond constraints (frozen
        sets of 2 elements) are supported.  if 'auto', then
        guess_pairwise_constraints is used to generate a list of constrained
        atoms. All of xyz is passed to this function; if more flexibility is
        desired, call it externally and pass its output through this argument.
    method (callable):
        Specifies what method to use to find the optimal map.
    kwargs:
        Passed to method.

    Returns:
    -------
    If only_return_forces, return an np.ndarray of shape
    (n_steps,n_cg_sites,n_dims) which contains the optimally mapped forces.
    If not only_return_forces, a dictionary with the following elements is
    returned:
        projected_force =
            np.ndarray of shape (n_steps,n_cg_sites,n_dims).
        map =
            Map characterizing the optimal force map.
        residual =
            Force map residual calculated using force_smoothness. Note that this
            is not performed on a hold-out set, so be wary of overfitting.
        constraints =
            Set of frozensets characterizing the molecular constraints on the
            system. Useful if constrained_inds is set to 'auto'.
