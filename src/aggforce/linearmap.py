def make_bond_constraint_matrix(n_sites, constraints):
    r"""Makes a molecular constraint matrix connective a generalized mapping
    coefficient to the expanded mapping coefficient.

    When creating optimal force maps, atoms which are molecularly constrained to
    each other are most easily handled by having them share mapping
    coefficients. We do so by creating a reduced mapping vector, that when
    multiplied by the matrix this function produces, creates a full sized
    mapping vector.  Optimization may then be performed over the reduced (or
    generalized) vector.

    This is done by creating a matrix that duplicates pertinent indices in the
    reduced vector over multiple atoms. This results in (as an example) a
    matrix like this:
        [1 0 0 0]
        [0 1 0 0]
        [0 1 0 0]
        [0 0 1 0]
        [0 0 0 1]
    when multiplied by a reduced vector [a b c d] on the right, this results in
    the vector [a b b c d], i.e., sites 1 and 2 are constrained to have the
    same value.

    Arguments
    ---------
    n_sites (integer):
        Total number of sites in the system. In the context of the quadratic
        programming in this module, usually the number of fine-grained
        particles in the system.
    constraints (set of frozensets of integers):
        Each member set contains fine-grained site indices of atoms which are

    bond constraints does not make it clear that all three of these atoms are
    (for the purpose of force mappings in this module ) all constrained
    together. This method replaces the two bond constraint entries with a 3 atom
    constraint entry, but does so for all atoms and all sized constrains such
    that the returned list of constraint's members are all disjoint.

    Arguments

        - aggregates forces from atoms which are constrained with atoms included

    No weighting is applied to the forces before aggregation.

    For example, if we use a carbon alpha slice configurational mapping, any
    carbon alphas which are constrained to hydrogens will have the forces from
    those hydrogens aggregated with their forces. Carbon alphas that are not
